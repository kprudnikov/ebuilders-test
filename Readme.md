# What could have been made better:

- Carousel is not truly infinite (goes to the first step after finishing)
- Not enough errors handling in public methods and functions
- 'Select' styling (and styles structure in general) is a bit sloppy
- Validation messaging and more interactive behavior (on keystroke, blur etc instead of waiting for form submitting)
- Better feature detection (e.g. for placeholders)
- Better interaction between page and ARIA states
- Files concatenation, minimization etc
- Autotests
- Refactor
